## Environment Variables (No Changes Required)

Your existing environment variables remain unchanged:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_railway_postgresql_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret

# API
API_BASE_URL=https://lokal-prod-production.up.railway.app/api

# App Configuration
APP_NAME=Lokal
APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

---

## Testing the Streamlined Authentication

### Demo Mode Testing
```bash
# Test email-only auth in demo mode
1. Set DATABASE_URL=YOUR_DATABASE_URL (demo mode)
2. Enter any valid email format
3. Should auto-authenticate immediately
```

### Production Testing
```bash
# Test email verification flow
1. Set proper DATABASE_URL
2. Enter real email address
3. Check console for verification token
4. Verify email verification works
```

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users
- Current password-based auth remains functional
- New users get streamlined email-only flow
- Gradual migration as users return
- No data loss or disruption

### For New Users
