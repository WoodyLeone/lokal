# Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem
The Railway deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/index.js'
```

## Root Cause
Railway was looking for the entry point file in `/app/index.js` but the files were in the root directory. The issue was with the start command configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `railway.json`
- Changed `startCommand` from `"node index.js"` to `"npm start"`
- This ensures Railway uses the npm start script which is more reliable

### 2. Updated `Procfile`
- Changed from `web: node index.js` to `web: npm start`
- This maintains consistency with the Railway configuration

### 3. Created `.railwayignore`
- Added a comprehensive ignore file to exclude unnecessary files from deployment
- This prevents deployment issues caused by large or unnecessary files

### 4. Created `test-deployment.js`
- Added a test script to verify deployment configuration
- Run with: `node test-deployment.js`

## Files Modified
- `railway.json` - Updated start command
- `Procfile` - Updated to use npm start
- `.railwayignore` - New file to exclude unnecessary files
- `test-deployment.js` - New test script

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway:**
   - Push to your Railway-connected repository
   - Or use Railway CLI: `railway up`

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check Railway logs for successful startup
   - Test the health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`

## Environment Variables
Make sure these environment variables are set in Railway:
- `PORT` (Railway sets this automatically)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- All Supabase and Redis credentials from `railway.env.example`

## Health Check
The application includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that Railway will use to verify the deployment is working.

## Troubleshooting
If deployment still fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Run `node test-deployment.js` locally to verify configuration
4. Check that the repository is properly connected to Railway
