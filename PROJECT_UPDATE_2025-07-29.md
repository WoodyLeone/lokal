# Lokal Project - Complete Update (July 29, 2025)

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Lokal** is a fully functional shoppable video platform that allows users to upload videos, detect objects using AI, and match them to purchasable products. The system has been completely rebuilt and tested to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## ✅ Major Achievements

### 1. **Object Detection System - 100% Fixed**
- **Problem Solved**: Removed all fake object generation that was causing incorrect product matching
- **Solution**: Implemented real YOLOv8 detection with proper validation and filtering
- **Result**: System now only detects and matches products based on actual video content

### 2. **Complete Backend Architecture**
- **Node.js/Express API**: Fully functional REST API with proper error handling
- **Python Integration**: Seamless YOLOv8 object detection integration
- **Database Integration**: Supabase PostgreSQL with proper RLS policies
- **File Upload**: Support for large video files (up to 500MB)
- **Real-time Processing**: Background video processing with status updates

### 3. **Frontend Applications**
- **React Native App**: Complete mobile app with video upload and product browsing
- **iOS Native App**: SwiftUI-based native iOS application
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on iOS and Android devices

## 🔧 Key Technical Fixes

### 1. Object Detection Accuracy
- **Before**: Generated fake objects like "laptop", "book", "bottle" when detection failed
- **After**: Only uses real objects detected by YOLOv8
- **Validation**: Proper confidence thresholds and frequency filtering
- **Fallback**: Context-aware suggestions only when people are actually detected

### 2. Video Processing Pipeline
- **Upload**: Support for multiple formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV)
- **Processing**: Background processing with progress tracking
- **Detection**: YOLOv8 with frame extraction and aggregation
- **Matching**: Intelligent product matching based on detected objects
- **Cleanup**: Automatic temporary file cleanup

### 3. Database Integration
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities
- **RLS Policies**: Secure row-level security for data access
- **Storage**: Organized file storage with proper permissions
- **Authentication**: User management and session handling
