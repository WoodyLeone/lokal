# LokalRN Current Status & Setup Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
LokalRN is a React Native app built with Expo that provides video sharing with object detection and product matching capabilities, integrated with Supabase for backend services.

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Dependencies & Configuration** ✅

- Package.json scripts are comprehensive and functional
- Babel, Metro, and Tailwind configurations are correct
- TypeScript configuration is properly set up

### 2. **Supabase Integration** ✅
- Supabase client is properly configured
- Environment variables are set correctly
- Database connection is working
- Authentication system is functional

### 3. **Database Schema** ✅
- All required tables exist and are accessible:
  - `profiles` - User profiles
  - `videos` - Video metadata
  - `products` - Product catalog
- Sample data is present (4 products)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are configured

## ⚠️ What Needs Manual Setup

### 1. **Storage Buckets** ⚠️
**Issue**: Storage buckets cannot be created automatically due to RLS policies.

**Required Action**: Manual creation in Supabase dashboard

**Buckets Needed**:
- `videos` (public, 500MB limit, video formats)
- `thumbnails` (public, 10MB limit, image formats)

**Steps**:
1. Go to https://sgiuzcfsjzsspnukgdtf.supabase.co
2. Navigate to Storage section
3. Create both buckets with specified settings

## 🔧 Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm start              # Start Expo development server
npm run android        # Start Android development
npm run ios           # Start iOS development
npm run web           # Start web development

# Setup & Verification
npm run setup-complete    # Complete setup process
npm run verify-supabase   # Verify Supabase connection
npm run setup-storage-manual  # Manual storage instructions

# Maintenance
npm run clean         # Clean and reinstall dependencies
npm run reset         # Complete reset and setup
```

## 📱 App Features

### Core Functionality

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Create Storage Buckets (Required)
```bash
npm run setup-storage-manual
```
Follow the instructions to create the required storage buckets.

### 2. Verify Complete Setup
```bash
npm run verify-supabase
```
This should show all green checkmarks once storage buckets are created.

### 3. Start Development
```bash
npm start
```
The app should now be fully functional.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Storage Buckets Still Missing
1. Follow manual setup instructions
2. Check Supabase dashboard permissions
3. Ensure buckets are public
4. Verify RLS policies are configured

### If Dependencies Issues
```bash
npm run clean
npm install
```

### If Expo Issues
```bash
npx expo install --fix
npx expo start --clear
```
