## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Your React Native App
Your app is now ready to use the Railway backend. Deploy it to your preferred platform:
- Expo Go (for testing)
- App Store / Google Play Store
- Internal distribution

### 2. Monitor Performance
- Use the provided monitoring scripts
- Check Railway dashboard regularly
- Monitor user feedback and app performance

### 3. Optional: Set Up Custom Domain
If you want a custom domain for your Railway backend:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to Settings > Domains
4. Add your custom domain
5. Update the `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in your app

### 4. Scale as Needed
Railway provides automatic scaling, but you can:
- Monitor usage in Railway dashboard
- Adjust resource allocation if needed
- Set up alerts for performance issues

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Connection Timeout**
   - Check Railway service status
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Use the monitoring script to test endpoints

2. **Object Detection Fails**
   - Ensure video is fully uploaded first
   - Check video format compatibility
   - Verify video processing status

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor Railway dashboard for resource usage
   - Check if auto-scaling is enabled
   - Consider upgrading Railway plan if needed

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Test backend connectivity
node test-railway-connectivity.js

# Test complete pipeline
node test-railway-complete.js

# Monitor performance
node monitor-railway-performance.js

# Check Railway status
railway status
```
